My name is Ian Bouchard, a.k.a Corb3nik. I'm currently a student at Laval University (Canada),
studying a bachelor's degree in computer science.

I love CTFs, I do almost every online CTF available on [ctftime.org](http://ctftime.org). My main focus is on web application security for the CTF team [OpenToAll](https://opentoallctf.github.io/). I'm also learning reverse engineering and
binary exploitation on the side.

When I'm not doing CTFs, I usually work on wargames and bug bounties. I also post writeups for
challenges from time to time.

Here are some wargames I train on :
  - [Ringzer0 Team CTF](http://ringzer0team.com) (General Purpose Wargames)
  - [Root-me](https://www.root-me.org) (General Purpose Wargames)
  - [websec.fr](https://websec.fr/) (Web-oriented Wargames)
  - [RPISEC MBE](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE) (Binary Exploitation Course)
  - [PentestIt](https://lab.pentestit.ru/) (Pentest Lab)

<br/>
See you guys in the next CTF ;)
