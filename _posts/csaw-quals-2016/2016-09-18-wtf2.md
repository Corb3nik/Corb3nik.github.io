## Description

```
WTF.SH(2)               Quals               WTF.SH(2)

NAME
       wtf.sh - A webserver written in bash

SYNOPSIS
       wtf.sh port

DESCRIPTION
       wtf.sh is a webserver written in bash.
       Do I need to say more?

FLAG
       You  can  get  the flag to this second part of
       the problem by getting the website to run  the
       get_flag2 command. Sadly, I can't seem to find
       anything in the code that does that :( Do  you
       think you could take a look at it for me?

ACCESS
       You can find wtf.sh at http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/

SUPERHERO ORIGIN STORY
       I have deep-rooted problems
       That involve  childhood  trauma  of  too  many
       shells
       It was ksh, zsh, bash, dash
       They just never stopped
       On that day I swore I would have vengeance
       I became
       The Bashman

## The Challenge

This is the second part of the CSAW WTF web challenge.

This challenge consists of 100% bash web server in which we have to try to execute the `get_flag2` command on.
Unlike the first challenge `wtf.sh (1)`, the `get_flag2` is not available in the code, so the goal of the challenge is to obtain RCE.

## Obtaining the Source Code

Like in the first challenge `wtf.sh (1)`, we need to leak the source code to know what we're dealing with.

We can do so through a file traversal vulnerability in the `post.wtf` page.

Browsing to `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/post.wtf?post=../` will leak the contents of some of the source code files:

![get_source](/assets/img/csaw-quals-2016/get_source.png "get_source")

One can notice through the leaked source code some calls to the `source` bash command.
This gives us some idea of what the filenames are; we can leak these files directly now.

Here are the available files:

- `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/user_functions.sh`
- `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/post_functions.sh`
- `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/spinup.sh`
- `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/wtf.sh`
- `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/lib.sh`

## Finding the Vulnerability

As we've mentionned earlier, the goal of the challenge is to obtain RCE somehow.

Looking through the source files, we see the core function for displaying webpages (`include_page` in the `wtf.sh` file):

```bash
max_page_include_depth=64
page_include_depth=0
function include_page {
# include_page <pathname>
local pathname=$1
local cmd=""
[[ "${pathname:(-4)}" = '.wtf' ]];
local can_execute=$?;
page_include_depth=$(($page_include_depth+1))
if [[ $page_include_depth -lt $max_page_include_depth ]]
then
local line;
while read -r line; do
# check if we're in a script line or not ($ at the beginning implies script line)
# also, our extension needs to be .wtf
[[ "$" = "${line:0:1}" && ${can_execute} = 0 ]];
is_script=$?;

# execute the line.
if [[ $is_script = 0 ]]
then
cmd+=$'\n'"${line#"$"}";
else
if [[ -n $cmd ]]
then
eval "$cmd" || log "Error during execution of ${cmd}";
cmd=""
fi
echo $line
fi
done < ${pathname}
else
echo "<p>Max include depth exceeded!<p>"
fi
}
```

Starting from the top of the function, we can understand that:

- The URI that we request is sent to the `pathname` variable.
- The `pathname` must end with `.wtf`
- The command that we want to execute must be prefixed with the `$` character.
- Later down the road, the command is executed through `eval`

Knowing this, we look around the source code to find potential file upload vulnerabilities.

... Which brings us to the `reply` function in `post_functions.sh`:

```bash
function reply {
local post_id=$1;
local username=$2;
local text=$3;
local hashed=$(hash_username "${username}");

curr_id=$(for d in posts/${post_id}/*; do basename $d; done | sort -n | tail -n 1);
next_reply_id=$(awk '{print $1+1}' <<< "${curr_id}");
next_file=(posts/${post_id}/${next_reply_id});
echo "${username}" > "${next_file}";
echo "RE: $(nth_line 2 < "posts/${post_id}/1")" >> "${next_file}";
echo "${text}" >> "${next_file}";

# add post this is in reply to to posts cache
echo "${post_id}/${next_reply_id}" >> "users_lookup/${hashed}/posts";
}
```

This function adds a reply to a post by creating a file on the filesystem.
It is called through a `POST` request at `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/reply.wtf?post=efG5D`.

Here are the lines of code responsible for creating a file on the filesystem :

```bash
next_file=(posts/${post_id}/${next_reply_id});
echo "${username}" > "${next_file}";
echo "RE: $(nth_line 2 < "posts/${post_id}/1")" >> "${next_file}";
echo "${text}" >> "${next_file}";
```

The interesting part of those lines is the first one, which assigns an `array` to the `next_file` variable for some reason (notice the `()`).
This line of code is also vulnerable to path traversal, as we control the `post_id` value.

With this in mind, we can easily set `next_file` to the value of our choice.

Let's send a `POST` request to `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/reply.wtf?post=../payload.wtf+` (notice the added url-encoded space character at the end).

Inside the `reply` function, `next_file` will be assigned the following : `(posts/../payload.wtf /1)`.

Bash arrays are created by seperating each element in the array by spaces.
If we want to create an array with elements from 1 to 5, we would do `array=(1 2 3 4 5)`.
Now if we want to print the first item of an array, we would do `echo ${array[0]}`, or simply `echo ${array}`.

Therefore, our payload will create an array `next_file` with two elements : `posts/../payload.wtf` and `/1`.
Since `${next_file}` will return the first element of the array, the following lines :

```bash
echo "${username}" > "${next_file}";
echo "RE: $(nth_line 2 < "posts/${post_id}/1")" >> "${next_file}";
echo "${text}" >> "${next_file}";
```

... will redirect output to `posts/../payload.wtf`.

Which makes are payload accessible through `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/payload.wtf`.

## Getting the Flag

Now that we can write arbitrary files, we need to execute the `get_flag2` command.

With the payload from earlier, the `payload.wtf` file will have the following structure :

```
my_username
RE: the_original_post_title
my_reply
```

As we have mentionned earlier, the `include_page` file only `eval`'s our code if the line starts with a `$`.
Since we control the username, let's register a user called `$get_flag2`.

Rerunning the payload above, we create the file :

```
$get_flag2
RE: the_original_post_title
my_reply
```

Requesting the `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/payload.wtf` will now run the `get_flag2` command and print the flag.
