## The Challenge

We are given a simple form which, given a user agent string, will show us the percentage of users using that user-agent.

For example, if we were to enter the string "asdf", we would see a page like the following:

![result](/assets/img/dctf-quals-2016/result.png "result")

With a bit of fuzzing, we notice that our string is being inserted in the database through an `INSERT` statement.

![insert](/assets/img/dctf-quals-2016/insert.png "insert")

... So we are dealing with SQL injection in an `INSERT` statement.

For SQL injections in `INSERT` statements, the goal is usually to inject the result of subqueries and function calls.
In order for this to work though, the newly inserted rows would need to be printed out on the screen at some point, which isn't the case.

We'll have to figure out some other way to get our subquery/function call results back.

## Filters

Going through the error messages with various SQL injection payloads, we see that some of our keywords are being filtered out.

For example, giving the payload `' or a or a)#`, we get an SQL syntax error message with the `or` keywords removed :

![filters](/assets/img/dctf-quals-2016/filters.png "filters")

We can assume that the webapp simply replaces the keywords with an empty string and runs the resulting string as an SQL query.

Therefore, we should be able to bypass each keyword by adding the keyword inside itself like this : `oorr`.

The webapp would catch the `or` in the center and remove it, result in a new `or` keyword.

We'll use the following to bypass the filters :

```
frfromom => from
oorr => or
loaload_filed_file => load_file
selselectect => select
```

### Final Payload

At some point through fuzzing, I noticed an interesting MYSQL error message when using the payload `' OORR 'asd')#`:

![error](/assets/img/dctf-quals-2016/error.png "error")

Looks like the statement is trying to parse the `asd` string as a `datetime`. Since `asd` isn't a valid date, it is printed on the screen.

We can abuse this to print out the result of any function call we want.

Here is the final payload that we use to obtain the flag :

`' OORR (SELSELECTECT DATE(LOLOAD_FILEAD_FILE('/flag')) FRFROMOM DUAL))#`

With this payload, we get the content of `/flag` through `LOAD_FILE` and try to parse it as a `DATE`.

Since the flag is most likely not a date, an error message is thrown, printing our flag on the screen.

![flag](/assets/img/dctf-quals-2016/flag.png "flag")
