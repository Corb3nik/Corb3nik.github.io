#### The Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to find out who attacked your website.

The challenge came with a log file containing all the requests sent to your fictional website, including IPs and timestamps :

    192.241.254.77 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:01:32 +0000] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 403 283 "-" "curl/7.35.0"
    [ ... ]
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:03 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:04 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:05 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:06 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:06 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:07 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:08 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:09 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    37.139.17.15 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:10 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 5613 "-" "Python-urllib/2.7"
    192.241.254.77 - - [15/Nov/2015:16:28:11 +0000] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 200 283 "-" "curl/7.35.0"


The list consisted of two attackers `37.139.17.15` and `192.241.254.77`.

The interesting one was `192.241.254.77` as it was the only IP that generated a `200` response from the `/admin` page.

<br>
Browsing to that IP reveals nothing but a plain text "go away" message :

    $ curl http://192.241.254.77/
    go away


<br>
A reverse lookup of the IP reveals `www.williestoleyour.pw` :

    $ nslookup 192.241.254.77
    Server:   10.10.10.10
    Address:  10.10.10.10#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    77.254.241.192.in-addr.arpa name = www.williestoleyour.pw.

    Authoritative answers can be found from:
    . nameserver = d.root-servers.net.
    . nameserver = e.root-servers.net.
    . nameserver = i.root-servers.net.

<br>
Not much to go on here, nothing in the source code and searches through [dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) and [w3dt](https://w3dt.net/tools/dnsrecon) didn't reveal much.

The contact section had the following email : `info@williestoleyour.pw` :

![williestoleyour.pw](/assets/img/9447-2015/willie.png "williestoleyour.pw")

<br>
<br>
A search through the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) reveals the same website with a different email `info@dynamiclock.pw`:

![web.archive.org](/assets/img/9447-2015/wayback.png "williestoleyour.pw")

Visit [dynamiclock.pw](http://dynamiclock.pw/) and scroll to the bottom and you'll find your flag!
