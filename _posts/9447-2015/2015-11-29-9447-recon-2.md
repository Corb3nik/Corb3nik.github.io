#### The Challenge

Starting from the end of Recon 1, we end up on the website [dynaniclock.pw](http://dynamiclock.pw).

The website is a single page with static content and a form where you can fill in a name, email address and a message.

![form](/static/img/9447-2015/flag.png "form")

<br>
After filling the form, we receive an email:

    From : Mailer <admin@dynamiclock.pw>
    Subject : John, thank you for signing up

    Thank you for registering your interest. We will contact you some time in the next week.

<br>
We can examine the header of the email to find the IP of the sender :

    Received: from www.dynamiclock.pw (dynamiclock.pw [162.243.7.88])

<br>
Browsing to that IP gives us a vCard for the nickname `dynamicWarl0ck`!

![warlock](/static/img/9447-2015/warlock.png "warlock")

<br>
From this point, we can use a service like [namechk](https://namechk.com/) to list his accounts. We find that `dynamicWarl0ck` has an account on github and bitbubucket.

Going through both accounts, we find a project in which he has three [commits](https://bitbucket.org/dynamicWarl0ck/dynamics/commits/all), one of which is registered under his real name : William Clutterbuck!

**Flag** : 9447{William.Clutterbuck}
