## The Challenge

  We need to go through the nullcon videos that have been uploaded in may 2015.

  For each video, you can check the transcripts and search for the words "gift" and "russia".

  We found 1 video with matches to these keywords : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_PvN_A1ts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_PvN_A1ts)

  The ID of the video refers to the parameter `v` in the url.
